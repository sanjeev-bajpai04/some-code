            The 1st Generation Computers were introduced using the technology of vacuum tubes which
            can control the flow of electronics in a vacuum. These tubes are usually used in switches
            amplifiers, radios, televisions, etc. The First Generation of Computer was very heavy and
            large and were not ideal for programming. They used basic programming and didn’t have an 
            which made it tough for users to do programming on them.  1st Generation Computers required
            a big room dedicated to them and also consumed a lot of electricity.<br>

        <p>
            The Second Generation of Computers revolutionized as it started using the technology of  
            transistors instead of bulky vacuum tubes. Transistors are devices made of semiconductor 
            materials that open or close a circuit. These transistors were invented in the Bell Labs
            which made the <a style="color: #f50a41"  href ="https://meet.google.com/cwn-zdcq-kyf?pli=1" > second generation computer</a>
             powerful and faster than the previous ones. 
            Transistors made these computers smaller and generated less heat compared to the vacuum
            tubes they replaced. The Second Generation of Computers also introduced the use of CPU, 
            <a  style="color: #fd1010" href ="https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome" > memory</a>
            and input/output units. The programming languages used for the second-generation
            computers were FORTRAN (1956), ALGOL (1958), and COBOL (1959).... Read more at

        A Shakespearean sonnet is a poem that is fourteen lines long, as this
         traditional with sonnets, that follows a rhyme scheme of ABABCDCDEFEFGG, 
         and uses iambic pentameter. This means each sonnet is made up of three quatrains
          (set of ABABs), with a final rhyming couplet. Typical of Shakespeare’s sonnets, 
          the lines two lines tend to summarize the sonn...
